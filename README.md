### 🧠 About Me

Career changer who went from banking to building software. Spent 5 years translating complex financial products into plain English — now I do the same with code.

Started coding in high school (mobile apps), took a detour through competitive esports and retail banking, then went all-in on software engineering through Hack Reactor.

**What drives me:** Making things that help other people ship faster. Whether that's fixing flaky tests, writing docs that actually help, or building tools that eliminate friction.
