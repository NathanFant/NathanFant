# 👋 Hey, I'm Nathan Fant — Software Developer, Builder, and Problem Solver

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a full-stack software developer who thrives on building cool things from scratch and solving problems with clean, practical code.

My journey into tech started in high school, where I spent three years immersed in mobile app development. I fell in love with the process of turning an idea and a blank screen into something real and functional. After graduating, I took a detour into the world of competitive Fortnite, playing at a semi-pro level for about a year. Then came my first attempt at college for computer science — which got cut short thanks to COVID.

Around that same time, life gave me two incredible things: the news that I’d soon be a father, and the chance to marry my best friend. I spent the next few years working in retail banking, developing the kind of communication and people skills that tech folks don’t usually talk about — but they’re real, and they matter.

Eventually, the opportunity to chase my dream came back around, and I took it. I joined the Hack Reactor full-stack software engineering bootcamp and never looked back.
